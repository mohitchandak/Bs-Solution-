Browser automation without using automation frameworks. let's say two browsers are installed in the system.
chrome and firefox.
3 APIs would be hit by specifying the browser name to which that action need to taken.

Task is to create these 4 apis and should work via any browser UI.

1. clear cache and history of the given browser.
ex -> /clear?app=firefox

2. to open a given URL in the given browser.
ex -> /open?app=firefox&url=https://www.google.com

3. to close the browser.
ex -> /close?app=chrome
